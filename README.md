<h2>Curiosity Rover Photos</h2>
This project is built using React App, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Google Fonts and Google Images, and more. The information is retrieved from NASA's open API source to render images taken on mars from an one of the 7 cameras on an active mission from the rover.

## User Stories
> As the user, I want to navigate a user-friendly website.
> As the user, I am coming to the site to check out recent photos captured by the Mars Curiosity Rover. 
>As the user, I want to see the name of the Rover and name of the camera used to capture the shot. 


## MVP Goals
> A fully functional 3rd party API webpage using React and at least 4 components. 
> Use of flexbox or CSS grid.
> An About Page
> A Sign up form
> Button Functionality with routing in React
> Deployed to Heroku 

## Notes:
Because of the large amount of photos, the API may return "try again." The API only allows a certain amount of calls per day.
